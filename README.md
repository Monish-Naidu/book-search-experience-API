# A book search experience API

----

## CRUD Methods:

* Add, remove, and update books in my library
* Find books by a particular author
* Find all books published in a given date range
* Find books on a certain subject or genre (i.e scientific books, sci-fi, horror, reference)
* Group books together into lists (i.e "my favorite sci-fi books of 2016")
*Combine any of the above to create a more complex search query (i.e all horror books published by Stephen Hawking between 1815 and 1820)
* Mark a book as "loaned out" to an individual
* Remind the individual I loaned my book to that they need to return it by some date I've chosen
* Add, remove or update notes about a particular book for later reference
* See which books are loaned out and to whom; also see whether they have returned them on time or not
